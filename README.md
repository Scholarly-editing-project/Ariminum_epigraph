### Prerequisites

In order to execute **Ariminum Epigraph** locally on your machine you must follow some steps:

1. Download **Node.js** from [here](https://nodejs.org/it/download/).
2. Download **Github desktop** from [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. **Clone** this repository using **Github desktop**. [Guide here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/).
3. Open the terminal using [OSX](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line) or [Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089).
4. Navigate inside the **Repository** you have downloaded in **step2** using the Terminal. **E.g.** if the folder is in "~/Desktop/folder/" you have to write down `cd ~/Desktop/folder/` in the terminal to be moved into the folder. [Info here](http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/how-to-use-terminal-the-basics/) 
5. According to the configurations stored inside **package.json** file, you can run the server by writing `npm run start`.
6. Navigate with a browser in **localhost:8080**.
